I've been tinkering with this blog for the past three years
documentation isn't clear:
  - struggled to find info on `.eleventy.js` config file
  - data doesn't contain your posts, but bits of data (like your navigation, static metadata)
  - once you figure out what goes where it seems really good.
  - collections are quite straightforward to create.
