I created and deployed this Blog during the Indie Web Camp Berlin 2017.

I learnt about [Microformats](http://microformats.org/wiki/Main_Page) , [indieAuth](https://indieauth.com/).

I met a bunch of friendly people. 

So far, to make this blog I'm using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to generate the site, [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/) for styling, and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for deploying.

For now there's not much to show at all.

All the code is hosted on github!
